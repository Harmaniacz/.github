<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Harmony connects people with new friends using the language of music.</p>
<p>It was created in three months by a team of five Software Engineering students from the University of Ottawa as part of the SEG 2900 course.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, and Git were all part of the tech stack.</p>
<p>Each team member added a webpage to the website.</p>
<p>The team met weekly to discuss ideas and offer progress reports on their state.</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>The team was among three selected from 28 groups to present their startup idea to a 200-person audience, including a panel of three CEOs and founders from the Ottawa area.</p>
<p>Harmony placed second in both the audience and judges categories.</p>
